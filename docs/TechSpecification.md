# Project Scope

A platform for bootstrapping MVPs for side-projects with fair and sustainable incentive alignment. Project owners can summon flash organizations where members work towards pre-defined product milestones. Contributors who apply to a project / projects can receive puttable equity tokens for their work upon achieving the pre-defined product milestones, with an option of “exit to cash” that settles to pre-arranged strike price, exercisable within a limited timeframe.
